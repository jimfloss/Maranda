Maranda
===

Maranda is a base WordPress theme built off of the '_s' theme and tailored to the work that I do on a daily basis. This theme relies heavily on the jQuery library, Bootstrap 4 grid system, and Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet (SASS) for styling. The object of this theme outside of simply being a base for all of my WordPress Theme projects moving forward is to improve code reusability, project load time, programmatically increase project SEO value and provide the best user experience in the least amount of time utilizing forward thinking code methodologies and beautiful code.
